Introduction
JavaScript was created by Netscape’s Brendan Eich in 1995. It was originally intended as a simpler scripting language for websites, complimenting the use of Java for more complex web applications, but its tight integration with Web pages and built-in support in browsers has caused it to become far more common than Java in web frontends.

JavaScript isn’t just limited to web browsers, though: Node.js, a project that provides a standalone runtime for Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, is becoming more and more popular.

<i>Type <code>next</code> to move to the next session.</i>
============
1. Numbers, Strings and Operators
JavaScript has one number type (which is a 64-bit IEEE 754 double). Don't freak out about the lack of ints: doubles have a 52-bit mantissa, which is enough to store integers up to about 9✕10¹⁵ precisely. You can try to enter some values, like:
<code>3;</code>
<code>1.5;</code>
<i>When you want - type <code>next</code> to move to the next task.</i>

2. Numbers, Strings and Operators
JavaScript has even negative zero!
Try it now!
===========
3. Numbers, Strings and Operators
All the basic arithmetic works as you'd expect.
<code>8 - 1</code>
<code>10 * 2</code>
<code>35 / 5</code>
Including uneven division.
<code>5 / 2</code>
<i>When done, type <code>next</code> to move to the next session.</i>
===========
4. Numbers, Strings and Operators
Bitwise operations also work; when you perform a bitwise operation your float is converted to a signed int *up to* 32 bits.
<code>2 << 3</code>
<code>1.5 << 2</code>
Precedence is enforced with parentheses.
<code>(1 + 3) * 2;</code>
<i>Type <code>next</code> to move to the next session.</i>
===========
5. And now to the functions!
JavaScript functions are declared with the function keyword.
<code>
function myFunction(thing){
    return thing.toUpperCase();
}
myFunction("foo");
</code>
<i>Type <code>finish</code> to finish tutorial, and enter Free mode.</i>
===========
Free mode
Now you can play with javascript on your own!
